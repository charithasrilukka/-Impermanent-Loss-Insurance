# Impermanent Loss Insurance

## Project Description
Implement protection against liquidity provider losses through a decentralized insurance mechanism. This smart contract allows liquidity providers to purchase insurance policies that protect them against impermanent loss when providing liquidity to automated market makers (AMMs). The system enables users to pay premiums upfront and claim compensation when they experience losses due to price divergence between paired assets.

## Project Vision
To create a robust and trustless insurance ecosystem that protects DeFi liquidity providers from the inherent risks of impermanent loss, encouraging more participation in liquidity provision and strengthening the overall DeFi ecosystem. Our vision is to make liquidity provision safer and more predictable, reducing barriers to entry for new participants while providing peace of mind for existing liquidity providers.
